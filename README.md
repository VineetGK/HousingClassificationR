# CS699 Project: Machine Learning Model for Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is developed as part of CS699 and focuses on data preprocessing and machine learning modeling using R. The main objective is to clean and analyze data, handle missing values, and train a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values through omission and imputation
- Conversion of categorical variables for better model performance
- Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for classification
- Performance evaluation using ROC curves and other metrics

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
cd repository
```

Ensure that you have R and RStudio installed. The required libraries can be installed using:

```r
install.packages(c("psych", "mlbench", "caret", "randomForest", "tidyverse", "dplyr", "pROC"))
```

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in R:

```r
source("project_code.R")
```

Ensure that the dataset `project_data.csv` is available in the working directory before execution.

## Configuration
If the project requires specific configurations, ensure that the dataset paths and preprocessing parameters are correctly set in the script.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following R packages:
- `psych`
- `mlbench`
- `caret`
- `randomForest`
- `tidyverse`
- `dplyr`
- `pROC`

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a Pull Request.
